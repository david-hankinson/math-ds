This code defines a Python class called `Quadratic_formula` that is used to solve quadratic equations of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). Here's a breakdown of the code:

### 1. Importing the `math` Module
```python
import math
```
- The `math` module is imported to provide access to mathematical functions, specifically `math.sqrt()`, which is used to calculate the square root.

### 2. Defining the `Quadratic_formula` Class
```python
class Quadratic_formula:
```
- This line defines a new class called `Quadratic_formula`. A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances of the class) with specific attributes and methods.

### 3. Initializing the Class with the `__init__` Method
```python
def __init__(self, a, b, c):
    self.a = a
    self.b = b
    self.c = c
```
- The `__init__` method is a special method called a constructor, which is automatically invoked when an instance of the class is created.
- It takes three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the coefficients of the quadratic equation.
- These parameters are assigned to instance variables `self.a`, `self.b`, and `self.c`, so they can be used throughout the class.

### 4. Defining the `solve_function` Method
```python
def solve_function(self):
```
- This method calculates the roots of the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.

#### 4.1. Calculating the Discriminant
```python
discriminant = self.b**2 - 4*self.a*self.c
```
- The discriminant \( \Delta \) is calculated using the formula \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \). The discriminant determines the nature of the roots.

#### 4.2. Handling Different Cases Based on the Discriminant
- **Case 1: Discriminant > 0 (Two Real Roots)**
  ```python
  if discriminant > 0:
      x1 = (-self.b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * self.a)
      x2 = (-self.b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * self.a)
      return(f"The root of this equation is: x={x1} and x={x2}")
  ```
  - If the discriminant is positive, the equation has two distinct real roots. The roots are calculated using the quadratic formula:
    \[
    x1 = \frac{-b + \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}, \quad x2 = \frac{-b - \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
    \]
  - The method returns a string with the two roots.

- **Case 2: Discriminant < 0 (Two Complex Roots)**
  ```python
  elif discriminant < 0:
      real_path = -self.b / (2 * self.a)
      imaginary_path = math.sqrt(-discriminant) / (2 * self.a)
      root_1 = complex(real_path, imaginary_path)
      root_2 = complex(real_path, -imaginary_path)
      return root_1, root_2
  ```
  - If the discriminant is negative, the equation has two complex roots. The real part and the imaginary part are calculated separately.
  - The method returns the two complex roots as a tuple.

- **Case 3: Discriminant = 0 (One Real Root)**
  ```python
  else: 
      root = -self.b / (2 * self.a)
      return root
  ```
  - If the discriminant is zero, the equation has exactly one real root. The method returns this single root.

### 5. Creating Instances of `Quadratic_formula` and Solving the Equations
```python
x = Quadratic_formula(2, 3, 2)
x2 = Quadratic_formula(1, -5, 6)
x3 = Quadratic_formula(1, -4, 4)
```
- Three instances of the `Quadratic_formula` class are created with different coefficients \( (a, b, c) \):
  - `x` represents the equation \( 2x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0 \).
  - `x2` represents the equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).
  - `x3` represents the equation \( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \).

### 6. Solving the Equations and Printing the Results
```python
final_value = x.solve_function()
final_value2 = x2.solve_function()
final_value3 = x3.solve_function()

print(final_value)
print(final_value2)
print(final_value3)
```
- The `solve_function` method is called on each instance to solve the respective quadratic equations.
- The results (`final_value`, `final_value2`, `final_value3`) are stored and printed:
  - `final_value`: The output for the equation \( 2x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0 \) (likely complex roots).
  - `final_value2`: The output for the equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) (two distinct real roots).
  - `final_value3`: The output for the equation \( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \) (one real root).

### Summary
This code effectively solves quadratic equations, handles different types of roots (real and complex), and outputs the solutions.
